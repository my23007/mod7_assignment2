Introduction:
The increasing deployment of IoT devices in Systems of Systems (SoS), such as smart homes, introduces various security risks, particularly as the Connectivity of the system grows. SoS are characterized by their interconnected nature, where individual subsystems operate autonomously but contribute to a larger purpose (Boardman & Sauser, 2006). As the number of connected devices grows, the system's attack surface may expand, leading to increased exposure to cyber threats. This paper explores the hypothesis: Does increasing the number of connected devices in an IoT-based smart home system decrease the overall security by increasing the systemâ€™s attack surface?

Features:
Controller Class: The Controller class remains mostly the same, verifying message integrity and logging latency.
SHA-256 Hashing for message integrity verification.
Configurable network condition simulations, including tampering, packet loss, and delay.
Logging of message status at both client and controller for easy debugging and analysis.

Usage
Run the Controller (Server): The Controller runs in a separate thread, listening for incoming connections from clients.

Configure and Run the Client: The Client connects to the Controller and sends a series of test messages with simulated network issues, based on user-defined configurations.

Related work
As the number of endpoints in a network rises, so does the likelihood of security vulnerabilities being exploited. To mitigate these risks, encryption is often used as a first line of defense in IoT systems (Li, Lou & Ren, 2020). However, encryption can have an effect on the system performance as it introduces computational overhead (fastercapital,2024)

Experiment Results:
In this study, the experiments demonstrate that encryption significantly mitigates security risks by preventing unencrypted data transmission, which is consistent with findings by Alrawais et al. (2017). However, encryption adds latency, particularly as the number of devices increases
The integrity verification system demonstrated strong security effectiveness, accurately detecting and rejecting tampered messages, thereby mitigating the risk of data compromise. Reliability under network disruptions was reasonable, although implementing a message retry protocol could further enhance system robustness.

Key Findings:
-Latency: Minimal impact under standard conditions, but noticeable at high throughput.
-Security: Effective tampering detection with SHA-256 hashing, enhancing system integrity.
-Reliability: Stable handling of delays, with room for improvement in handling message loss.

Recommendations:
-Consider optimized hashing algorithms or selective hashing methods to reduce latency for high-frequency messaging.
-Integrate a retry protocol to enhance reliability in lossy network conditions.
-Expand the security model to address other vulnerabilities identified in the Attack-Defense Tree, such as secure message encryption alongside integrity verification.
